# **Written report on the employee database analysis


## **Overview of the analysis**

This report aims to report and present insights about the performance trends and patterns of the Pycity schools. It will inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level through using Pandas, the Python Data Analysis Library. This analysis includes retrieving and parsing the schools' data, such as accessing every student's math and reading scores as well as various information on the schools they attend and analyzing data on student funding and students' standardized test scores. This report will assist the school board regarding the school budgets and priorities.

## **Results**

*1. The Number of Retiring Employees by Title*
      -  Retirement Titles table holds all the titles of employees who were born between January 1, 1952, and December 31, 1955, with their recent titles. There are a total of 72458 employees who will be retiring in the coming years. The majority of retiring employees are *senior engineers*, which is 25916 people, while for the *manager* position, there are only 2 people to retire.
      -  There will be 25916 *senior engineers* and 24926 *senior staff* to retire in the coming years, taking up nearly 70% of the entire retiring employees. This means that the company needs to hire coming engineers and staff with proficient skills and at least several years of work experience. In addition, since there will be enormous new employees coming in the future, it is necessary to provide an appropriate job training system to facilitate new employees to be familiarized with their work environment.

*2. The Employees Eligible for the Mentorship Program*
      -  The mentorship-eligibility table holds the current employees who were born between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965, which are eligible to participate in a mentorship program. As the data shown, there are 1550 employees who are qualified as mentor at Pewlett Hackard. 
      - As for the available mentors, there are 568 employees are eligible for senior staff, 169 employees for the position of senior engineer, while there is no employee eligible for the position of manager.

## **Summary**

As the CSV file of *retiring_titles* shown, seven roles need to be filled in the "silver tsunami" program: senior engineer, senior staff, engineer, staff, technique leader, assistant engineer, and manager. According to the retiring amount of each job title, the "senior engineer" and "senior staff" take up 70% of the entire group, meaning the groups of these two positions need to pay more attention to connecting the eligible mentors and the coming new employees. 

Since 72458 employees will be retiring, and 1550 of them are eligible to be mentor, having more available mentors are necessary to enhance the impact of the "silver tsunami" program. Pawlett Hackard probably needs to change its criteria of choosing a mentor to enlarge its mentorship group.
